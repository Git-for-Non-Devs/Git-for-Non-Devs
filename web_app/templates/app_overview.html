<h1>Welcome to the Git-for-Non-Devs Project</h1>
<p>
We are on a mission to democratize knowledge building. We're developing a smartphone app to make Git's powerful collaboration and version control tools accessible to everyone, not just programmers.
</p>
<h2>Our Goal</h2>
<p>
Our app records discussions and organizes arguments into a Git graph based on similarity and distance. A machine learning algorithm performs argument and sentiment analysis in the background, helping users understand each other's ideas. Users can then merge their ideas or pull similar ones from our idea repository or the web, with appropriate policies in place.
</p>
<h2>Join Us</h2>
<p>
We believe that this app can transform how people collaborate and develop ideas. However, we need your help to make it a reality. Whether it's contributing to this repository or creating spin-offs, there's a place for you in our project.
</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
By making Git's logic accessible to non-programmers, we aim to break down silos and foster collaboration. Your support can help us achieve this goal. Thank you for considering our project.
