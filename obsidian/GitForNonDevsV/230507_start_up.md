# Title: Introducing Git for Non-Programmers: A Smartphone App for Idea Collaboration

# Overview: 

## Mission
We believe that knowledge should be built collaboratively, and that the best ideas come from diverse perspectives. However, many people feel intimidated by technical tools like Git, which is a powerful version control system commonly used by software developers. That's why we're developing a smartphone app that brings the logic of Git to non-programmers, allowing anyone to collaborate on ideas and enhance them based on the suggestions of others.

Our app works by recording discussions and organizing the arguments into a Git graph based on their similarity and distance. In the background, a machine learning algorithm does argument and sentiment analysis to help users better understand each other's ideas. The app then allows users to merge their ideas or pull similar ideas from an idea repo database or the internet (with a policy layer in place to prevent misconduct).

# The goal 

The goal  of our app is to introduce a catalyst for new ideas and to enhance existing ones through collaboration. We believe that this can help break down silos and prevent conflicts between groups, as people work together to build up knowledge.

## Why We Need Your Help: 
We're a small team of developers who are passionate about the power of collaboration. However, we need your help to bring this idea to life. We need funds to cover the cost of developing the app and the cloud data warehouse to store user repos. We also need to hire additional developers and machine learning experts to help us build and refine the app.

## What You'll Get: 

By backing our project, you'll get early access to the app and the opportunity to help shape its development. You'll also be supporting a project that has the potential to make a real impact on how people collaborate and build knowledge.

## Conclusion: 
We believe that our app has the potential to revolutionize the way people collaborate and build ideas. By bringing the logic of Git to non-programmers, we hope to empower people to work together and break down silos. With your support, we can make this vision a reality. Thank you for considering our project.

Make a image, with a smartphone frame and a example image in the idea  app enables non-programmers to collaborate on ideas by structuring and versioning them, similar to Git.  Users can merge their ideas or pull similar ideas from an idea repo database or the internet. Make a image of a possible eample  graph of a users discussion based on the git graphs


i need your help to write a kickstarter proposal for a project which goal it is to bring the git logic to non programmers. The agent to do that is a smartphone app, which can be switched on when discussing ideas and topics. The discussion is recorded and the arguments order in a git graph, based on the similarity and distance of the arguments, meaning a LLM runs in the backround to do the argument and sentiment analysis. Based on this analysis, the users are offered to merge their ideas or to pull similar ideas from a idea repo db or th internet (mind a policy layer here!), meaning that we would need a cloud datawarehourse to enable to store the repos of the users. The overall goal is to introduce a catalyst for new ideas or to enhance ideas based of the suggestions of the internet or the idea repo db. The overall vision is to avoid that humanity is stuck in patterns , based on the idea that we need to build up knowledge together and not in silos in order to avoid conflict between groups.
