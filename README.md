### Imagine a Project: 
#### Which is not about the big bucks
#### Which is not about showing off
#### Which doesn't have an exit-strategy
#### Which doesn't have complex and slowing down company structures
#### Which doesn't have silos
#### Which doesn't have entry requirements (so that non-tech people can be users as well as become devs)

## Overview
We believe that knowledge should be built collaboratively, and that the best ideas come from diverse perspectives. However, many people feel intimidated by technical tools like Git, which is a powerful version control system commonly used by software developers. That's why we're developing a smartphone app that brings the logic of Git to non-programmers, allowing anyone to collaborate on ideas and enhance them based on the suggestions of others.

## Goal
Our app should work in future by recording discussions and organizing the arguments into a Git graph based on their similarity and distance. In the background, a machine learning algorithm does argument and sentiment analysis to help users better understand each other's ideas. The app then allows users to merge their ideas or pull similar ideas from an idea repo database or the internet (with a policy layer in place).

The goal of our app is to introduce a catalyst for new ideas and to enhance existing ones through collaboration. We believe that this can help break down silos and prevent conflicts between groups, as people work together to build up knowledge in a structured and versioned way.

## Why We Need Your Help
Currently, it's just me working on this project, but recent events have highlighted the urgency of bringing the Git approach of communication to everyone. We need to structure opinions, arguments, thoughts, and anything that can shield against disinformation and disorientation. Additionally, with the low barrier of creating software thanks to code-bots and AI, it only feels natural to expand the scope of Git. We invite you to join us in working on this repository or creating spin-offs.

## Conclusion
We strongly believe that our app has the potential to revolutionize the way people collaborate and build ideas. By bringing the logic of Git to non-programmers, we aim to empower people to work together and break down silos. With your support, we can turn this vision into a reality. Thank you for considering our project.
